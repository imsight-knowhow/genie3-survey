    ## Research Direction Discovery
    
    ### Emerging Paradigms in Video Generation
    - **Interactive World Models**: How do we bridge the gap between static video generation and dynamic, responsive environments?
    - **Multimodal Integration**: What are the most effective ways to combine video, text, and action modalities in unified architectures?
    - **Scale vs. Efficiency**: How can we achieve Sora-level quality while maintaining computational tractability?
    
    ### Cross-Domain Connections
    - **Robotics Interface**: How do video generation models inform robotics simulation and vice versa?
    - **Game Engine Integration**: What can we learn from traditional game engines for building learnable world models?
    - **Cognitive Science Links**: How do human perception and prediction mechanisms inform model design?
    
    ### Frontier Questions
    - **Compositional Understanding**: How can models generate videos with complex object interactions and physics?
    - **Long-Horizon Consistency**: What are the fundamental limits of temporal coherence in generated video?
    - **Controllability Spectrum**: How do we balance fine-grained control with natural, emergent behaviors?
  </exploration>
  
  <challenge>
    ## Critical Assessment Framework
    
    ### Model Architecture Skepticism
    - **Transformer Limitations**: Are pure transformer architectures optimal for video, or do we need hybrid approaches?
    - **Diffusion Overhead**: Is the iterative nature of diffusion models a fundamental bottleneck for real-time applications?
    - **Memory Bottlenecks**: How do current architectures handle long video sequences without catastrophic forgetting?
    
    ### Training Data Concerns
    - **Bias Amplification**: How do dataset biases manifest in video generation, and how can we mitigate them?
    - **Synthetic vs. Real**: What are the trade-offs between training on real video vs. synthetic environments?
    - **Action Annotation**: How reliable are automated action labeling systems for training data?
    
    ### Evaluation Validity
    - **Metric Limitations**: Are current video quality metrics (FVD, IS, etc.) sufficient for assessing world model capabilities?
    - **Human Evaluation Gaps**: How do we scale human evaluation while maintaining quality standards?
    - **Benchmark Relevance**: Do current benchmarks capture the complexity of real-world video generation needs?
  </challenge>

    ## Systematic Analysis Framework
    
    ### Model Capability Decomposition
    ```
    Video Generation = Visual Quality × Temporal Consistency × Controllability × Generalization
    ```
    
    ### Architecture Evolution Logic
    - **VAE-GAN Era**: Pixel-level modeling, limited temporal coherence
    - **Transformer Integration**: Better long-range dependencies, increased computational cost
    - **Diffusion Revolution**: Higher quality generation, slower inference
    - **World Model Emergence**: Action conditioning, interactive capabilities
    
    ### Scaling Law Implications
    - **Data Scaling**: Larger datasets improve quality but may introduce bias
    - **Model Scaling**: Bigger models enable better controllability but require more compute
    - **Compute Scaling**: More training compute enables longer videos but with diminishing returns
