# Task: Extract References from Academic Paper

## Description
Extract all reference papers from an academic paper and format them in IEEE citation style, saving to a references.md file in the same directory as the source paper.

## Command
• Read the academic paper file to locate the references section
• Extract all bibliographic references from the paper
• Format each reference according to IEEE citation standards:
  - Sequential numbering [1], [2], etc.
  - Author names (last name, first initial)
  - Paper/book titles in quotes or italics
  - Publication venue information
  - Publication year
  - Page numbers where applicable
• Create a comprehensive reference list with:
  - Clear section headers
  - Total reference count
  - Consistent formatting throughout
• Save the formatted references to `references.md` in the same directory as the source paper

## File Structure
• Source paper: `papers/{paper-name}/paper.md`
• Output file: `papers/{paper-name}/references.md`

## Example Usage
```
extract all references papers into a list in IEEE format, #file:{paper-directory-name}, save to the same dir as 'references.md'
```

## Notes
• The references section may be located at the end of academic papers
• Look for citation patterns like author names, years, and publication venues
• Ensure all bibliographic information is captured accurately
• Format consistently according to IEEE standards
• Include total count of references for verification
